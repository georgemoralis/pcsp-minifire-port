Test code for psp emulator

win32 build : interpeter and recompiler works (hmm recompiler is fast  , interpreter less than 1 fps)
win64 build : only interpreter 10% faster than win32 version

# TODO

* remove dx8 and replace it with opengl surface
* use imgui
* make it a proper psp emulator rather than hackish minifire demo port
